# New Execution Host

The independent host is built beside the current command-line and desktop host.
`dokime-runtime-next` composes plugin entries, scoped unary lifecycle dispatch,
controlled orchestration time and cycle execution. `dokime-operations-next` owns
one declaration and handler per supported host operation. `dokime-storage` owns
SQLite execution evidence and Arrow IPC sample batches. These crates have no
normal dependency on the old domain, runtime, server, client or facade.

## Run the Thermal Stories

Build the existing shared SDK plugin, then run either story by its full name:

```powershell
mise run build:host-fixtures
mise run test -- --package dokime-runtime-next --target system --exact thermal_suite_survives_host_restart::thermal_suite_survives_host_restart
mise run test -- --package dokime-runtime-next --target system --exact cancelling_a_thermal_step_runs_cleanup::cancelling_a_thermal_step_runs_cleanup
```

The fixture is `target/debug/dokime-rust-thermal` with the native executable
extension. `DOKIME_THERMAL_PLUGIN` can name an already built copy. Tests never
compile a plugin themselves. Both placements use the unchanged shared thermal
suite at `sdk/rust/examples/thermal.rs`.

The host requires explicit `HostSettings`: placement bounds and a
`SchedulerClock`. `ControlledClock` advances only through requested waits;
observers tick and commit samples before a plugin's host sleep settles.
Prompt arrival and cancellation use events, with no wall-clock sleeps.

## Serve Client gRPC

`services::serve(endpoint, root, host_settings, client_settings)` in
`crates/dokime-runtime-next/src/services/` binds a loopback endpoint and returns
`Server`; `endpoint()` exposes the chosen address and `close().await` cancels
active work, drains cleanup and closes the listener. Client settings supply
read, mutation and stream deadlines, case/page limits, message bytes and stream
buffer capacity.

The public `process::command` constructor starts owned child processes without
opening Windows console windows.

The `dokime-host-next` binary accepts `--endpoint HOST:PORT --storage PATH`.
It announces its bound HTTP URL on stdout, and stdin EOF requests graceful close.
Ordinary runs use UTC time; `--controlled-clock` is the deterministic story mode.
The storage root retains a backend identity; each process has a new boot epoch.
The bootstrap listener accepts loopback addresses. Remote manages a separate
TLS listener with one rotating backend access key. Export a pairing to enable it,
then import its endpoints, certificate and key on the client. Exporting again
invalidates every previous key, including on open channels; certificate rotation
requires a fresh pairing export. Reconfiguring the listener closes its existing
remote calls; reconnect and inspect the committed listener state after an uncertain
acknowledgement. TLS private keys remain in the OS credential
store; SQLite retains their slot identity and the access-key verifier.

Plugins, Catalog, Settings, Secrets, Backend, Appearance, Runtime, Remote and Health
serve every declared method, including their Run transports. Plugin installation
accepts verified v1 `.dokime` tar bundles with one native sidecar per target,
portable regular-file paths, matching size/digest inventory and a compatible
`dokime.json`. Managed entries start on restart; disabled installations stay
disabled. Replacement retains that state and restores the previous entry when
starting its replacement fails. Removing an entry preserves execution evidence.
Remote entries retain URL identity and descriptions while unavailable, and
reload reconnects them without taking ownership of the remote process. Plugin,
catalog and health reads probe connected entries on demand, retaining stopped or
changed processes as unavailable/failed entries and excluding them from admission.

Settings use revision-checked durable preferences and report bootstrap paths
without making them editable. Plugin settings remain editable while unavailable;
`dokime.settings.read` resolves saved values on demand in the calling execution.
Secret Storage uses generation checks, protected immutable credential slots and
bounded v1 base64 JSON files with explicit replace/skip choices. Secret values
are never written into the SQLite catalog. `dokime.secrets.read` reads the named
protected credential within the calling execution's scope. Headless hosts need
an available OS credential store for secret writes and TLS key persistence.

Catalog and Health paging binds the current process epoch and inventory;
installation paging binds its manifest digest. Restart paging after a stale
cursor refusal. Backend availability lists only served methods. Diagnostics
streams a verifiable ZIP containing backend identity and a bounded tracing tail;
log/trace follows await events and redact secret-looking structured fields.

Planning, Execution, Observation, Prompts and History serve every declared
operation and its Run form. Query ListExecutions, Evidence ListRecords, Telemetry
ListSamples and Reports DownloadExecutionReport/PublishExecutionReport retain their
existing serving. Backend availability advertises every served method. Other methods
return `UNIMPLEMENTED` naming the action; the owning OpenSpec task lists them.
Requests using unserved filter/cursor variants are explicitly refused.

Prompts serves all five operations and their bidirectional Run forms. Catalog
definitions page by prompt type; pending prompts page by ID with cycle and
execution filters. A changed selection or stale cursor requires restarting the
page. Respond validates declared actions, fields, answer rules and evidence
conditions, records the authenticated local responder and acknowledges durable
acceptance. GetPrompt retains the question and answer after settlement and
restart. `client_answers_operator_prompts` exercises this operator journey.

Planning serves preview, registration and materialization through both call
forms. Preview preserves selection order and duplicates without registering or
starting. Registration commits the complete bounded plan and its cases
atomically; the same key resolves its original reply after restart, while a
changed plan requires a new key. MaterializeTemplate registers one expanded
selection. Parameter expressions, defaults, Cartesian and zip dimensions, list
parameters and opaque file selections resolve before plugin materialization.
`client_plans_parameter_selections` proves the registration journey.

Execution serves all 28 operations and their Run forms. CreateCycle accepts
explicit origins or creates an empty mutable cycle for registered case bindings.
AppendExecutions atomically admits the supplied execution identities. Manual
cycles wait for StartExecution; automatic cycles admit their runs after append.
Interactive runs accept Next, RunStep and Finish with durable command receipts;
retrying a command ID resolves its existing receipt. Pause and stop apply at step
boundaries; cancel interrupts the active call and drains required cleanup.
Cycle/execution detail, ordered steps, parameter pages and case lists expose
backend-owned capabilities. Labels and archives remain editable presentation
without altering seals. `client_controls_execution_lifecycle` proves the journey.

Observation serves runtime shells, scoped traceability, runtime invalidations and
execution progress through both call forms. Runtime watches resynchronize first,
reject another epoch or a future revision, and settle on graceful shutdown.
Execution progress follows manager transitions and questions; each execution
settles independently. Cancelling either watch leaves its run active.
`client_observes_runtime_state` proves these contracts.

History serves all eleven operations and their Run forms. Checkpoint inspection
returns the existing seal, persistent backend identity and exact evidence cut;
reads never publish or create a newer checkpoint. Cycle browsing retains an
append-only saved frontier. Execution browsing returns a cursor that must be
repeated with unchanged filters and order. Record and sample continuations bind
the checkpoint and table; sample pages use bounded storage reads. Artifact
downloads stream metadata, ordered chunks, completion digest and a final
response; output windows return only the requested bytes. Deletion checks the
exact seal and retains a durable request receipt for retry resolution.
`client_browses_sealed_history` proves this workflow, including restart reads.

The service adapter adds `Host::record_answer`, `changes`, `signal_change`,
`is_shutting_down`, `execution_controls`, `start_execution_mode`,
`pause_execution`, `stop_execution` and `submit_execution_command`.
The storage owners are `crates/dokime-storage/src/plans.rs` (registration and
planned-case reads), `cycles.rs` (cycle headers, execution presentation, command
receipts, recovery and evidence times), and `history.rs` (saved frontiers and
idempotent sealed deletion). `Store::create_executions` admits complete origin
lists atomically. The added tables are `cases`, `registrations`, `cycles`,
`bindings`, `commands`, `cycle_history` and `deletions`, alongside the
`administration` table. Root validation requires that combined v1 layout and
refuses incompatible roots with backup and fresh-root/reset guidance; it never
migrates or deletes existing data.

Materialization returns frozen origins; CreateCycle admits and starts the
explicit origin list with `continue_automatically`, returning execution IDs.
Progress streams expose queued/prompt/finished events and end with a terminal
response followed by successful status. Cancelling a watch does not cancel the
execution. Pending prompt IDs combine execution identity and the plugin's prompt
name to keep concurrent executions distinct. Exact record and sample payloads
can be decoded using the catalog descriptors frozen in ExecutionDetail.schemas.
ExecutionDetail exposes the verified seal and cycle outcome counts; both detail
and execution listings carry backend-owned action capabilities. Listings count
evaluated, not-evaluated and declared outcomes separately, folding only evaluated
results into the verdict. Plugin listings retain unavailable descriptions after
restart and return Ready after explicit reattachment. Interrupted evidence uses
the same detail, listing, record, telemetry and progress reads.

Reports stream metadata, ordered chunks, SHA-256 completion and the terminal
response. Downloading reads an existing sealed report or renders a read-only
snapshot; neither path publishes. `Reports.PublishExecutionReport` explicitly
selects an execution and document, renders the fixed sealed snapshot, then stores
the frozen document, execution seal and independently sealed HTML. Rendering
failure publishes nothing. Subsequent downloads return the published bytes,
including after restart.

Build prerequisites and run the client stories through the focused task:

```powershell
mise run build:host-fixtures
mise -C sdk/python run sdk:prepare
mise -C sdk/python run sdk:build
mise -C sdk/python run sdk:install
mise run test -- --package dokime-runtime-next --target system --exact client_runs_thermal_suite_over_grpc::client_runs_thermal_suite_over_grpc
mise run test -- --package dokime-runtime-next --target system --exact python_client_runs_thermal_suite_over_grpc::python_client_runs_thermal_suite_over_grpc
```

The Rust story uses `dokime::client::HostClient` service conveniences over the
generated clients reexported by `sdk/rust`'s `dokime` package. The Python story uses the built pure wheel in the root `.venv/`;
`DOKIME_PYTHON` selects another explicitly prepared interpreter. Neither story
builds artifacts, polls, or sleeps on the wall clock. The Rust journey also starts
two executions in one cycle, answers their prompts differently and independently
reads their records through the client. The system target covers every host story,
including publication, interrupted recovery and every language-equivalence story.
Every story uses `SYSTEM_HANG_GUARD` from `tests/support/settings.rs`; operation
policies retain their own deadlines.

## Command-Line Candidate

`crates/dokime-cli-next` builds `dokime-next`, beside the old installed tool.
Hosting embeds the new runtime listener; remote commands use `sdk/rust`'s client
half. Build with `mise run build -- --package dokime-cli-next`.

```sh
dokime-next new first-plugin --lang rust
dokime-next new remote-plugin --lang python
dokime-next new managed-plugin --lang csharp
dokime-next new native-plugin --lang cpp
dokime-next plugin bundle --executable first-plugin/target/debug/dokime-starter --out first.dokime
dokime-next plugin inspect --bundle first.dokime --json
dokime-next --endpoint 127.0.0.1:7000 server --storage ./evidence
dokime-next --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:7000 plugin install first.dokime
dokime-next --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:7000 plugin add http://127.0.0.1:7001
dokime-next --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:7000 catalog list --json
dokime-next --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:7000 plan materialize --suite SUITE --template example.capture --out cases.pb
dokime-next --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:7000 cycle create --cases cases.pb --json
dokime-next --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:7000 execution prompt next EXECUTION --json
dokime-next --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:7000 execution prompt answer EXECUTION --action yes --accepted
dokime-next --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:7000 execution watch EXECUTION
dokime-next --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:7000 execution report EXECUTION --out report.html
dokime-next proto export --out proto
```

Bundles include `dokime.json` with an exact requirement for the bundling tool's
Dokime version. Run each generated project's `mise run build` before bundling its executable.
Rust's executable is `dokime-starter` (`.exe` on Windows); C# must be published as
a self-contained single-file executable for an executable-only bundle. Python
stays remote. C++ generation retrieves the versioned SDK archive's published
SHA-256 sidecar before creating the project; an unpublished candidate requires
paired `--sdk-url` and `--sdk-sha256` overrides. Existing destinations are refused.

`plugin dev --executable PATH` starts a built plugin remotely and prints its bound
URL; adding `--endpoint` attaches it to that host. Stdin EOF or Ctrl+C stops the
owned process. `plugin inspect --url URL` describes an independently running
plugin. Hosting uses the same EOF/interrupt close contract as `dokime-host-next`.

`--config PATH` reads explicit TOML settings; endpoint and storage may be supplied
there or on the command line. Unknown keys, zero bounds and zero deadlines fail.
`retained_bytes` also bounds CLI case files. The bootstrap host listener remains loopback; Remote manages authenticated TLS access.

```toml
endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:7000"
storage = "./evidence"
connect_timeout_s = 30
read_timeout_s = 30
mutation_timeout_s = 30
watch_timeout_s = 3600
reconnect_delay_ms = 25
stop_grace_s = 30
message_bytes = 4194304
retained_bytes = 67108864
stream_buffer = 8
max_cases = 1000
page_items = 1000
```

Materialized case files contain the authoritative `PreviewSelectionReply`
protobuf, preserving frozen origins. `--parameters PATH` reads a JSON object
mapping parameter names to arrays of canonical protobuf `Value` objects. For the
Python starter, supply `{"limit":[{"number":10}]}`. The host resolves the
selection and retains each registered case identity with its frozen origin.
`cycle append --request append.pb` reads an encoded
`ExecutionAppendExecutionsRequest` with the destination cycle and explicit
execution/case bindings. Cases come from materialization or registration;
automatic continuation starts appended executions, while manual cycles leave
them queued for `execution start EXECUTION`. `execution stop EXECUTION` requests
stopping at the next step boundary; answer an outstanding prompt so its current
step can settle. `cycle seal CYCLE` requires every execution to be sealed, and
`cycle rerun CYCLE` starts a new cycle from its frozen runnable origins.

The CLI system journeys exercise managed Rust installation/removal, remote Rust
and Python admission, prompt settlement, reports, append/start/stop and
seal/rerun. Build the generated starter fixture and run every story:

```sh
mise run build:cli-fixtures
mise run test -- --package dokime-cli-next --target system
```

Reports validate metadata, ordered offsets, total bytes, SHA-256 completion and
terminal status before creating the requested output; existing output is retained.
Human output is default and inspection/read commands offer `--json` with proto
field names. Diagnostics go to stderr; exit codes are 0 success, 2 invalid
arguments/configuration, 3 operational failure and 4 resource-capacity refusal.

The base host refuses managed `Plugins.Install`/`Plugins.Remove`, cycle
`AppendExecutions`/`SealCycle`/`RerunCycle` and execution
`StartExecution`/`StopExecution`. Their commands send real SDK requests and report
the host's named refusal. The service owners complete these independently;
`first_hour_from_rust_bundle_to_python_remote` requires their convergence.
`remote_first_hour_runs_rust_and_python` exercises the currently served route.
`scaffold_languages_and_export_protocol_without_a_host` covers all four starters,
existing-destination preservation and embedded proto export.

```sh
mise run build:cli-fixtures
mise run test -- --package dokime-cli-next --target system
```

The fixture producer uses `dokime-next new`, builds that exact generated Rust
project through its mise task against the local SDK candidate, and exports its
sources/executable with Tests. Stories compare generated source bytes and never
compile plugins. Tests Build includes this producer. `dokime installer package`,
old tool removal, installed binary naming and desktop migration remain cutover
work; installer packaging stays with the old tool until then.

## Compare Every SDK

The single thermal procedure is authored in each SDK: Rust `examples/thermal.rs`,
Python `examples/thermal/suite.py`, C# `tests/SystemPlugin` and C++ `tests/system`.
The host compares the complete frozen origin/test case, ordered evidence and
samples (including source time, sequence, position and exact payload), outcome
and cycle counts. Only run-specific execution identity, plugin digest/start time
and receipt timestamps are excluded. Sealed evidence must reopen unchanged.
Python and C++ also decode Door from retained schemas. C# registers record-only descriptors through Harmos Message<T>(); its named
`csharp_frozen_record_schema_decodes_door` assertion now decodes Door from the
frozen catalog at the exact de07fc54 Harmos revision.

Build the shared fixtures and install the Python wheel with the tasks above.
`build:host-fixtures` invokes each compiled SDK's own tasks and exports the
fixtures under `target/build/<profile>/<target>/fixtures/host/`. C# includes its
runtime. C++ builds Harmos's pinned dependencies; `HARMOS_SOURCE` and
`DOKIME_HARMOS_CACHE` can select existing workstation inputs. Tests never compile
fixtures. Local Tests Build includes every available compiled SDK fixture and the
full selection runs every story. Pull requests build Rust and Python and
run every story except the C# and C++ equivalence stories, which run in Nightly. Nightly
builds each language independently on Linux and Windows, caching the C++ SDK's
pinned native dependencies and installing .NET through mise, then runs every
story against exported artifacts. Suite failures are reported alongside the
publication result and do not block publication.

```sh
mise run test -- --package dokime-runtime-next --target system --exact python_plugin_matches_rust_thermal_evidence::python_plugin_matches_rust_thermal_evidence
mise run test -- --package dokime-runtime-next --target system --exact csharp_plugin_matches_rust_thermal_evidence::csharp_plugin_matches_rust_thermal_evidence
mise run test -- --package dokime-runtime-next --target system --exact cpp_plugin_matches_rust_thermal_evidence::cpp_plugin_matches_rust_thermal_evidence
```

Python runs remote; C# and C++ run remote and managed. Set
`DOKIME_CSHARP_THERMAL_PLUGIN` or `DOKIME_CPP_THERMAL_PLUGIN` for a prepared
executable outside the exported fixture path. `DOKIME_PYTHON` selects the
interpreter with the built wheel installed.

## Evidence and Recovery

Each execution freezes the complete PluginRun origin and catalog descriptors.
The manager owns live queued, initializing, stepping, evaluating and cleaning-up
state; those phases are not persisted as a Run. Step boundaries, acknowledged
records, logs, progress and criterion reads are durable evidence. Sample batches
retain source time, host receipt time, publication sequence and a durable position
shared with evidence entries. Interval streams use source UTC nanoseconds as
their axis. Step queries use the evidence positions at the step's time boundaries,
including equal-time events without admitting evidence from another step.

SQLite commits each Arrow IPC batch and its position atomically with FULL
synchronous durability. Streams close before evidence closes. A seal hashes the
frozen execution and ordered evidence bytes, and reopened reads verify it.
Writes after close are refused. Open plugin-run executions are recovered as
interrupted and sealed; import origins are never run-recovery targets.

Storage remains at v1. An unrecognized nonempty root is refused with instructions
to back it up and choose fresh storage or explicitly reset it. No migration,
implicit reset or deletion occurs.

## Cutover

CLI and desktop still use the old host. The integration cutover must migrate
those consumers, delete the superseded loop, crates and tests, and rename the
`-next` crates. The console-free process constructor is copied from `dokime-domain/src/process/`
into the new runtime. Delete its old owner at cutover; no old crate is imported.
The dispatcher uses the published `harmos.v1.Request.scope` field directly;
it does not call the old Harmos runtime's scope-losing invocation API and needs
no local path override. The native-runtime scoped-call adoption remains with
its owning cutover.
