# Repository Tooling

Mise is the public entry point. Python modules in `python/src/dokime_tools/`
own environment setup, synchronization, version metadata, binding generation,
frontend preparation, native packaging, CI and
test execution. The shared Python environment lives at repository-root `.venv/`.

The desktop GUI owns its web tooling under `crates/dokime-gui/`: Biome, the
pnpm lock and the RPC generator and screenshot capture in its `tools/`. Rust
performance workloads live under the owning crate's `benches/`.

Desktop development process trees are owned by the task-built `cargo-dokime`
executable with the application's validated packaging settings. `mise run dev`
selects that executable from its existing Cargo compiler record. The unchanged
`tauri:dev` and `build:report:watch` package commands select the development
artifact from `mise run build:rust` by default; `--build-json <record>` selects
another successful task build. Missing artifacts fail explicitly; these
launchers never build or install a supervisor. `tauri:dev --print-config`
continues to inspect frontend launch configuration without an artifact.
`operational.packaging.process_stop_ms` bounds each cleanup stage separately:
Unix gets one graceful-wait budget and one forced-reap budget, up to twice the
configured duration; Windows uses only the forced-reap budget. Surviving owned
descendants are terminated even when their leader already exited.

Each Python package carries its own `[tool.ty]` configuration. `lint:python`
type-checks the repository tooling with `ty check --project tools/python`;
`check:python:generated` type-checks the client package after the build has
verified its generated modules.
