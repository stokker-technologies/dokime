# Project Guidance

## Development Storage Policy

- Dokime is in development. Database schemas and evidence formats may change without version bumps for now; keep their baseline at v1.
- Clean database breaks are allowed. Do not add migrations or legacy compatibility solely to preserve development data. Use fresh storage roots when a schema change makes existing data incompatible; never silently delete or reset existing data.
